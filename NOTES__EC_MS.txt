--------------------------------------------------------------
Modified 16I23 so that it performs better as a cross-platform package.
16I23 modifications make the package compatible with Windows and with python2, in addition to the intended python3 on Linux.
Most of the modules have an "if __name__=='__main__':" part that demonstrates the usage of some of its functions.
The modules can be run from within the package, or, as is the main intention, imported with the EC_MS package. This is done with a
"from EC_MS import ..." statement in a script. In the folder Experiment sketched below, plot_01.py would import functions from EC_MS and 
use them to operate on the data in MS_data.txt and EC_data.mpt to generate plot_01.png
