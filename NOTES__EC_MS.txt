-------------------- 16I29 ------------------------------------------
Plotting functions moved to their own module
plot_masses_and_I uses tspan_2 by default
numerize is now done automatically when import_data is called
plot_vs_potential added to Plotting
remove_delay added to EC
text_to_data protected against commas as decimals. I hate commas as decimals.
np.where() replaced by a list comprehension in plot_masses
Implemented a few minor changes suggested 16I23 (see Improvements file)


-------------------- 16I23 ------------------------------------------
Modified 16I23 so that EC_MS performs better as a cross-platform package.
16I23 modifications make the package compatible with Windows and with python2, in addition to the intended python3 on Linux.
Most of the modules have an "if __name__=='__main__':" part that demonstrates the usage of some of its functions.
The modules can be run from within the package, or, as is the main intention, imported with the EC_MS package. This is done with a
"from EC_MS import ..." statement in a script. In the folder Experiment sketched below, plot_01.py would import functions from EC_MS and 
use them to operate on the data in MS_data.txt and EC_data.mpt to generate plot_01.png
